            This is a simple MP3 player and FM radio for kids. Playback functions can be controlled via the knobs while more complex features can be controlled from the player's web interface. These are the features in a nutshell:
            <ul>
                <li>MP3 playback, up to 96kbps stereo</li>
                <li>FM radio (integrated antenna)</li>
                <li>Disco mode (replays recorded sound on a pop music background)</li>
                <li>Walkie-Talkie mode when two players, or player &amp; phone can send voice messages via Telegram</li>
                <li>Integrated speaker or stereo headphones</li>
                <li>Configurable lights strip (breathe, larson scanner, music visualization, etc.)</li>
                <li>Alarm (any time, any day, any mp3, snooze function)</li>
                <li>Greetings (set of 3 welcome messages that will be played upon powering up the player at a specific day, such as birthdays</li>
                <li>Web Interface for advance controls</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="twelve" style="text-align:center;">
            <img src="player.png" style="width:100%; max-width:500px; text-align:center" /> 
        </div>
        <div class="twelve">
            The player has the following controls: Control knob (1) and Volume knob (2). Other elements are: LED strip (3), USB-C port for charging and headphone jack from the side (4), speaker (5) and microphone (6).
        </div>
        <form>
            <label>Knobs (1 and 2)</label>
            <div>
                Knobs can be rotated left or right. Each knob is also a button. The button can be pressed for a short time (press), or for a long time (approximately 1.5 seconds, long press). When attempting a long press the LED strip shows the necessary press duration. Both knobs can be pressed simultaneously (double long press). 
            </div>
            <label>LED Strip (3)</label>
            <div>
                Displays the visualizations and notifications. Upon start shows the battery level in red. When applicable, the strip also shows notifications as blinking edge LEDs:
                <ul>
                    <li>red for low battery</li>
                    <li>blue for active WiFi connection to preset network</li>
                    <li>cyan for active WiFi access point (the player creates its own network)</li>
                    <li>green for charging</li>
                    <li>yellow for active lights settings mode or waiting telegram message</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </form>
        <div class="twelve">
            Press either control (1) or volume (2) knob for approximately 2 seconds, until the LED strip flashes white to power the player on. Afterwards battery level will be displayed in red and the last music mode (mp3, radio, disco) will start playback. The player turns itself off automatically after 5 minutes when idle, or 30 minutes when playing music.
        </div>
        <div class="twelve">
            The player operates in 5 distinct modes, summarized below:
        </div>
        <form>
            <label>MP3 Player</label>
            <div>Playback of MP3 files stored in memory. Up to 8 playlists with 1000 songs each are supported.</div>
            <label>FM Radio</label>
            <div>Plays FM radio. Stations can be selected form a predefined list, or manually tuned.</div>
            <label>Disco</label>
            <div>Sound can be recorded and then played back on a disco music background for a karaoke effect.</div>
            <label>Light Settings</label>
            <div>MP3 or radio playback continues, but the control determines the effect to be shown in the LED strip and its color.</div>
            <label>Walkie Talkie & Web UI</label>
            <div>Connects to a predefined WiFi network, or starts its own so that the Web UI for advanced settings can be used and turns on the walkie talkie mode. The walkie talkie mode allows recording short audio messages and sending them to other players/phones via Telegram.</div>
        </form>
        <div class="twelve">
            Details for each mode are described in the appropriate Web UI settings. The table below then summarizes the effect of various controls in the modes:
