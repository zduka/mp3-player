# HW

- buy the extra things needed

# SW

- remove notifications from extended state

- radio frequency right after start still does not work well, maybe bigger interval

- headphones can be set to output and LOW to disable speaker any time

- add the following to the settings:
    - power off timeout
    - max speaker volume (4bits)
    - max headphones volume (4bits)
- read from SD card (some JSON)

# ATTiny

- temp is wildly off up to being useless

- what to do with connected to wifi notification? I do not want it on all the time, but there should be a way how to determine if connected or not

# ESP

- better integrate time update to the workflow, timezone support
- actually implement downloading telegram file

- check heap and health and reset when necessary


 # Missing Features

 - alarm clock
 - birthday reminder
 - disco mode

# Walkie Talkie

Maybe add a silence reduction as well (i.e values close to center are center).
