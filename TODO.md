- pressing control when idle? 

- should notification light do stuff if we are in non music mode? 

- radio frequency right after start still does not work well, maybe bigger interval

- headphones can be set to output and LOW to disable speaker any time

# ATTiny

- temp is wildly off up to being useless

# ESP

- walkie talkie state does not have to deal with the update
- be busy when uploading file & maybe even show progressbar


- better integrate time update to the workflow, timezone support
- add more telegram commands

- check heap and health and reset when necessary

# Walkie Talkie

- actually implement downloading telegram file
- maybe add a silence reduction as well (i.e values close to center are center). 

# Birthday reminder

First turn on when a date is set, a message is played. Maybe support more dates?
