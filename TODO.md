# HW

- make pins for TH bigger
- larger holes for audio jack
- update the audio src, tpa power, and attiny serial port accordingly
- add LEDs to the attiny & serial port (they can either go to the led strip kind of, or be behind the buttons)
- esp8266 PWM needs jumper to be either RX, or PWM


# ATTiny

- make sure that ADC is disconnected while sleeping

# ESP

- add playlists.txt to the SD card and determine how playlists are organized
- stream files from the server, when streaming, pause mp3 playback
- then read playlists & tracks and check TPA311 works
- seems even if wifi is not on by default, it still eats power
