# HW

# SW

- pressing control when idle? should start play?

- should notification light do stuff if we are in non music mode? 

- radio frequency right after start still does not work well, maybe bigger interval

- headphones can be set to output and LOW to disable speaker any time

# ATTiny

- enter sync mode after poweron unless WDT (or SW) reset
- wakeup & enter sync mode when given hour
- temp is wildly off up to being useless

# ESP

- OTA Updates should be checked on proper network and explicitly enabled in the remote
- mDNS should worn on proper network

# MP3

- simpler playlists management (just enable/disable/etc)

# Walkie Talkie

- maybe add a silence reduction as well (i.e values close to center are center). 

# Birthday reminder

First turn on when a date is set, a message is played. Maybe support more dates?
