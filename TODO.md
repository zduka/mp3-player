# HW

- check that I have all HW I need
- buy stuff at GM (battery holder, extra speaker and extra card holder)

# ATTiny

- reenable WDT - AVR seems to hang sometimes after wakeup from sync(?), likely just unstable circuit with programmer attached
- wakeup & enter sync mode when given hour, check that it works
- should notification light do stuff if we are in non music mode? 

# ESP

- format SD card if necessary (keep default basic settings in LittleFS)
- mDNS should worn on proper network

# Walkie Talkie

- maybe add a silence reduction as well (i.e values close to center are center). 

# Disco Mode

- is there time? how to enter?
