# MP3 Player

A simple and pretty low quality mp3 and fm radio player with the following main features:


## Controls

The player uses two rotary encoders with integrated buttons as the only physical controllers. The buttons support a short press and a long press, which is indicated on the led strip.

To turn the player on, a long press of either control, or volume is required.

> TODO should there be a lock mode where this does not work and some less accidental power on sequence will be used for travel, etc.?

The player can be in three modes - mp3 player, fm radio, and web interface. To change between the mp3 and fm radio modes, long press the control button.

> TODO How to enter the web interface mode? just long press both, or something more elaborate?

The volume controller always controls the audio volume and its press toggles play/pause(mute).

The control has different meaning based on the current mode. In the radio mode, short press triggers station presets, or manual tuning (if allowed). Turns then either change frequency, or present station. In the mp3 mode, 





Control: controls which mp3 track, or radion station will be played, switches between mp3 and radio modes.

Volume: controls the volume and play/pause. 

A lot more can be configured via the web interface.

## Basic Design

The attiny is responsible for the controls and device status maintenance (rtc, charging, I/O operations, such as switching audio source, detecting headphones, etc.). The ESP is responsible for actual playback (i.e. the mp3 songs from )

## TODO

- make esp send commands to avr (enable mode)
- manual and station tuning via control

- rewrite schematics for AC coupled headphones, make sure the noise is breadboard
- the 3v3 rail drops a lot when in boost mode, see why (breadboard?)


On avr:

- add I2C slave
- make attiny sleep and use RTC one second wakeup
- integrate power, strip and buttons into the player as well
- add ADC and start reading voltage
- add reading the audio out and showing this on the neopixel strip


On esp:

- read from avr

## AVR

- runs off the battery directly, i.e. can go as low as (2.6V), and as high as input (5V)
- this means that neopixel and rx pin must be level shifted
